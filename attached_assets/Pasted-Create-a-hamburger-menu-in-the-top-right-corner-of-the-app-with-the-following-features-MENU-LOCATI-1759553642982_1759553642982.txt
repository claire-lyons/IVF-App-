Create a hamburger menu in the top-right corner of the app with the following features:

MENU LOCATION & DESIGN:
- Position: Top-right corner of the navigation bar
- Icon: Three horizontal lines (hamburger icon)
- Opens: Dropdown/slide-out menu when clicked

MENU ITEMS (in order):

1. USER PROFILE SECTION (at top of menu):
   - Display user's name/email
   - Small profile icon or avatar
   - "View Profile" link

2. MY CYCLES:
   - Link to view all user's cycles (active & past)
   - Show active cycle count badge if applicable

3. START NEW CYCLE:
   - Button to start a new treatment cycle
   - Opens the cycle creation form

4. SETTINGS / MANAGE ACCOUNT:

   - Change password
   - Notification preferences
   - Timezone settings

5. SUPPORT & HELP:
   - Link to help documentation
   - Contact support option
   - FAQs link

6. ABOUT:
   - App version info
   - Privacy policy link
   - Terms of service link

7. LOG OUT (at bottom):
   - Red/prominent "Log Out" button
   - Confirms before logging out
   - Clears session and redirects to login page

FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Only show menu when user is logged in
- Menu should be responsive (works on mobile & desktop)
- Smooth animation when opening/closing
- Current page should be highlighted in menu
- Include icons next to each menu item for better UX

AUTHENTICATION:
- Log out should call Supabase signOut()
- Clear any cached user data
- Redirect to login page after logout
- Show confirmation: "Are you sure you want to log out?"

MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Full-screen overlay on mobile devices
- Easy to close with X button or back gesture
- Touch-friendly button sizes

Please implement this hamburger menu and ensure:
1. It appears on all logged-in pages
2. The menu items are clickable and functional
3. Log out works correctly with Supabase auth
4. Menu styling matches the current app theme
5. Test on both desktop and mobile views

Show me the implementation and let me know if any routes/pages need to be created for the menu items.
